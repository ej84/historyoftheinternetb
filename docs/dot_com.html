            <h1>Dot Com Bubble</h1>
            <p>In the late 1990, there was a big issue regarding with the stock markets on the Internet; the dot-com bubble. Dot-com bubble was a stock market bubble caused by excessive speculations in Internet related companies. After Internet use increased as a result of the reduction of the digital divide and advances in connectivity in 1993, the percentage of households in the U.S. that owned computers also increased from 15% to 30% between 1990 and 1997. This marked the shift to the Information age, a new economy based on the Information Technology, and  many new companies for it also were founded.</p>
            <p>Many investors were highly eager to invest at any values in dot-com based company such as ebay and Amazon. Investment banks, which profited significantly from initial public offerings (IPO), fueled speculation and encouraged investment in technology. A combination of rapidly increasing stock prices in the quaternary sector of the economy and confidence that the companies would turn future profits created an environment in which many investors were willing to overlook traditional metrics, such as the priceâ€“earnings ratio, and base confidence on technological advancements, leading to a stock market bubble. </p>
            <p>On January 31, 1999, a total of two Dot-Com companies had purchased ad spots for Super Bowl XXXIII. Around the turn of the millennium, spending on technology was volatile as companies prepared for the e. There were concerns that computer systems would have trouble changing their clock and calendar systems from 1999 to 2000 which might trigger wider social or economic problems, but due to large-scale efforts to correct the bug before the year 2000, there was virtually no impact or disruption. On March 15, 2000, Yahoo! and eBay ended merger talks and the Nasdaq fell 2.6%, but the S&P 500 Index rose 2.4% as investors shifted from strong performing technology stocks to poor performing established stocks.</p>
            <p>As the aftermath of burst of the dot bubble, venture capital became no more available, and the operational mentality of executives and investors completely changed. A dot-com company's lifespan was measured by its burn rate, the rate at which it spent its existing capital. Many dot-com companies ran out of capital and went through liquidation. Supporting industries, such as advertising and shipping, scaled back their operations as demand for services fell. However, many companies were able to endure the crash; 48% of dot-com companies survived through 2004, albeit at lower valuations. Online companies like ebay and Amazon, exceptionally, could make and claim their own capital power and have been continuing their business as living legend today.</p>
