            <h1>Internet Searches</h1>
            <p>During the early stages of the internet, finding what you were looking for was next to
                impossible. Jerry Yang and David Filo were two college students who always messed around.
                They had an idea which made them millions of dollars. It all started when Yang and Filo wanted
                to find a sneaky way to win a Stanford fantasy baseball league. David figured out a way to go to
                different places to collect all the data they needed using the unorganized internet. They thought
                about how people who have no idea what they are doing need a guide to navigate through the
                internet. They created “Jerry and David’s guide to the web” and later changed the name to
                Yahoo.
            </p>
            <p>Yahoo was an instant success and attracted millions of people, however, they wanted to
                make money out of this. No one used the web to generate revenue. Some even considered the
                idea evil. They were very hesitant about incorporating advertisements to their search engines
                and were afraid that they would face backlash from the public. Despite this, they implemented
                the ads and to their surprise, the search engine kept growing. This meant that more ads were
                coming in and that they were generating more money. They proved people can make money
                from the internet.</p>
            <p>Many of Yahoo’s rivals were starting to rise and become very popular, the biggest one
                being Excite. Excite was pure software so their technology was more sophisticated. Eventually,
                search engine companies got greedy and lost sight of their original purpose, to search for items
                on the web.
            </p>
            <p>Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin and they focused their search
                engine on actually searching rather than posting a lot of advertisements for money. Page
                believed that a link from one website to another was a kind of a recommendation and they built
                their search engine around that idea. The more clicks it had, the higher it would be on the page.
                Despite being advanced, no company wanted to help Google. Except for a man named Andy
                Bechtolsheim who immediately recognized it’s worth and gave them a check of $100,000.
                Eventually they got checks from other people totaling one million dollars. However, Page and
                Brin were spending money fast on the development of Google and could not even stomach the
                idea of putting ads in their site. They feared becoming a cluttered mess like Yahoo. They
                wanted their ads to be user friendly. They copied the advertisements of a company called
                Overeture in which they use keywords to sell people products. For example, BMW displayed on
                the top when the keyword is car. When it was release in 2004, it was a tremendous success and
                made billions of dollars.</p>
