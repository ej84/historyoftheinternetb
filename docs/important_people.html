            <h1>Important people</h1>
            <p> In the very long time ago, people use phones only for calling someone, use typing machine for writing, and get information from the newspaper. However, since the personal computer that is like we are using was developed and windows operation system was made, there have been a huge wave of changing the whole living style of people in the world which led us to the global digital generation. </p>
            <p>In 1999, there was napster that people use to download and share a lot of music files through the Internet. Shawn Fanning, the developer of napster, was also passionate for enjoying the music and his desire to put the music into the online space got him found the napster for serving people with limitless types of music for free. It was a very interesting and radical thing to try, but it did not go on so long. The music industries and famous music group such as Metallica sued Shawn for violating the copyright law and the napster was eventually forced to stop serving on July, 2001.</p>
            <p>After much more time later, youtube, the online channeling and video playing service platform was developed but it has been the most powerful and popular web in the world despite the fact that youtube also got issued with copyrights. Many people in the world regardless of their gender, location, and age, are using youtube to post videos that they create for their own contents and share them with a bunch of people through online streaming so they can earn huge money, be popular, or show the world who they are and what they can do. </p>
            <p>Likewise, the facebook, developed by Mark Zuckerburg, has been one of the most influential SNS(social network service) since people can write what they think about something they truly care about, take and upload their photos and appeal it to the other people on facebook to get connected and communicate with more friends all over the world. Even if the industries or artists who did not like the endless digitalization and changes of the online cultures for many reasons and tried to suppress it, the digitalization and evolution of the web pages have been a very important part of our lives and been creating futures that we would have never imagined to see in the past.</p>
