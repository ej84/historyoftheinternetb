            <h1>Browser Wars</h1>
            <p>In 1993, a young Marc Andreessen was always fascinated with the world wide web.
                Back then, however, there were only a few websites and those websites consisted of rows of
                boring text for the average person. Andreessen had always dreamed of everyone using the
                internet in their daily lives so he tried to improve it and make it user-friendly. He added picture,
                audio and video capabilities on the web. His best invention, however, was the world’s first
                graphical web browser which was called Mosaic. In 1993, they posted their innovation online
                and asked for beta testers in the newspaper. He got 12 replies at first but it boomed in
                popularity and it went from 12 - one million in months.</p>
            <p>Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft, established a near monopoly over PC operating systems
                and because of that, he gained a grip over the entire computer industry. Gates dropped out of
                Harvard at the age of 19 to team up with his friend, Paul Allen, to make Microsoft. He wanted
                everyone to have desktops that would run Microsoft software and almost achieved it in 1993.
                About 90% of the people who owned a desktop computer were running Windows and because
                of this, made billions of dollars in profit. Gates, however, was very aggressive when it came
                down to running a business. He made many companies fall to their knees, including the popular
                IBM.</p>
            <p>Andreessen teamed up with Jim Clark, founder of Silicon Graphics which made him a
                legend in Silicon Valley. They planned to build a new browser based on Andresseen’s past
                work, Mosaic.Their new company was called Netscape and when it came to the new browser
                they had a big sense of urgency because they were afraid that a big company, like Microsoft,
                would make a browser before them. Gates had doubts about the web browser and was not
                focused on it. However, many of his employees knew that this would change the world. Thomas
                Riodran, one of said employees, attempted to snoop at Netscape and was shocked when they
                responded with arrogance.</p>

            <p>In 1994, Netscape’s new browser was released to the public. It was an instant
                success. Many companies believed that the power of the browser could be used as an alternate
                platform rather than being forced to use Microsoft. Gates was very worried about their new
                competitors and he knew that he needed to crush them.
            </p>
            <p>Netscape hired an antitrust lawyer by the name of Gary Rebeck. Gary Rebeck clashed
                with Microsoft many times because of his clients in Silicon Valley. Netscape hired the lawyer
                because Microsoft had threatened them when they were having a meeting. The meeting was
                very controversial because Microsoft stated that everything was nice and ran smoothly in the
                meeting. Netscape stated otherwise and told the press that Microsoft told them to either sell
                their company for a million dollars or go bankrupt once they copy everything. If this was true,
                then Microsoft broke the antitrust law. They believed that Netscape set them up so that they
                may be taken down and would rise to power.
            </p>
            <p>Netscape believed that they have won, however, Microsoft revealed that they
                were planning on making their own browser called Internet Explorer. Gates had an army of
                salesmen who forced people to use only their new browser and nothing else. However, the
                reason why Netscape lost was due to the fact that Microsoft had a lot of money. Netscape made
                their profit by making people pay to use their browser, however, Microsoft’s browser was entirely
                free and made Netscape lose the browser war.</p>
